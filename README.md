# Sherlock

Sherlock makes pretty graphs of your internet history. Check out a few of these graphs below.

## Activity by Time of Day

On this graph, each dot represents visiting a website once.
Only my 16 most visited websites from the past 3 months of browsing while on my laptop and using Chrome are shown.
Since I generally use my phone in the morning, my desktop at night, and Firefox for dev, this data is somewhat incomplete.

### Analysis

#### Sleeping Hours

I generally don't use the internet from 11:00 to 8:00.
This is partially because of the use of other devices and browsers, but
matches up with my sleep schedule fairly well.

#### Frequently Visited Sites

This graph really highlights how my internet usage is dominated by just a few sites.
Google, Imgur (via Reddit), Github, Facebook, GMail, Youtube, 
Reddit, Stackoverflow, Google Code, Wikipedia and Google Drive
are where I spend the vast majority of my time.

`resme.me` is for the Reddit Enchancment Suite; it is opened on every update.
`d20pfsrd.com` is a D&D site which I use very occassionally.
I've read a few articles on `businessinsider.com`.

Really, I only use about 10 sites on the internet regularly.
This seems pretty damn small considering the millions (more?) of sites across the world.


## Activity by Day of the Week

This graph is just like the one above, but with a different time scale.

### Analysis

This really is the wrong graph for this data. A daily or hourly bar chart would be much better.
